### Developer Notes ###

Since 1.1.1, you can make use of ```'hybridauth:authenticate', $provider``` plugin hook
to perform some actions, when the user is authenticated with a provider. This might be a good place
to post stuff to user's wall or to grab a profile picture.

Example of how to post to the user's wall that the user Joined the site:

```php

// do stuff when the user is authenticated with one of the providers
elgg_register_plugin_hook_handler('hybridauth:authenticate', 'all', 'elgg_hybridauth_on_authenticate');

function elgg_hybridauth_on_authenticate($hook, $provider, $return, $params) {

	$user = elgg_extract('entity', $params);

	try {
		$ha = new ElggHybridAuth();
		$adapter = $ha->getAdapter($provider);
		if ($adapter->isUserConnected()) {
			$status = $user->name . ' just joined ' . elgg_get_config('sitename') . ' at ' . elgg_get_site_url();
			$adapter->setUserStatus($status);
		}
	} catch (Exception $e) {
		// Something is wrong
	}
}

```


## Upgrading

### To 1.3

* For performance reasons, ```HYBRIDAUTH_PUBLIC_AUTH``` is not longer defined.
Call ```elgg_get_plugin_setting('public_auth', 'elgg_hybridauth')``` where needed.

* ```base_url``` and ```debug_file``` are no longer set via plugin settings.
They are set dynamically using current installation path and wwwroot.

* Due to recent changes in LinkedIn scopes, HybridAuth was producing unreliable results.
HA LinkedIn class and LinkedIn wrapper were replaced with custom implementation for the sake of stability.
